An update for anyone interested in the xiaomi mi plug mini wifi version. It has the big advantage that once set up, you don't need to put it within range of a xiaomi aqara gateway - it can be anywhere your local wifi network will reach.

The miio project is now available as python-miio http://python-miio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

I could not get the CLI to work with the old M1 model I got cheaply from gearbest - I updated the firmware as soon as I got it via the awful mihome app and that may have been a mistake as xiaomi sometimes upgrade the firmware to make it harder to use the device outside their ecosystem. Ain't capitalism grand?

Fortunately the classes work fine when called directly in python, so I can switch on and off with some tiny python scripts - use:
CODE: SELECT ALL

miio discover
to learn the token and ip for your device, then create a text file something like:
CODE: SELECT ALL

#!/usr/bin/python3
import miio

good = {'ok'}
foo = miio.chuangmi_plug.ChuangmiPlug(ip="your device ip",debug=1,token="your device token")
res = foo.on()
# want to be able to rely on a non-zero exit to indicate failure to the calling script..
if res==good:
    exit(0)
else:
    exit(1)

seems to do the needful.

use foo.off() in a copy of the above script to turn it off.
foo.status() can be used to get the status including temperature and power for printing if they're available.
Mine shows:
<ChuangmiPlugStatus power=False, usb_power=None, temperature=40load_power=None, wifi_led=None>

I'll update here when I get these little scripts working in domoticz - I want to be able to control a heater...
